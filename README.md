# IPL Cricket Analytics (2008–2025)

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**.  
The objective is to derive meaningful insights at **Match, Team, and Player** levels through data cleaning, querying, and interactive dashboards.


## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Analytical queries and aggregations  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics  
- **Excel** – Query result validation and exports  


## Project Workflow
1. Raw IPL match and delivery data was cleaned and transformed using Python  
2. SQL queries were written to analyze match, team, and player performance  
3. Interactive dashboards were built in Power BI with KPIs, slicers, tooltips, and charts
